# Neko Game Engine 
develop branch: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/EliasFarhan/NekoEngine.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.com/EliasFarhan/NekoEngine)

NekoGame is a 3D game engine that works on Windows and Linux, forked from the Neko repo that is used at [SAE Institute Geneva](https://sae.swiss).
This is my own personal fork that I use as a testing ground for experimentation, however I do intend for it to be a fully functional game engine in the future.

## Installation
### Requirements
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) to generate the project files.
- [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for running the different scripts available.
- [Vulkan SDK](https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/) (Optional) if you're plaaning on working with Vulkan.

Clang is recommended to compile the engine.

### Steps
- Clone the repository.
- Setup CMake as you usually would with your favorite IDE.
- Build the 'GenerateDataTool' in release to generate the files needed for assets compilation.
